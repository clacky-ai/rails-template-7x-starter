Description:
    Generate a minimal CRUD controller for an existing model (MINIMAL VERSION).
    This generator creates only controller with action stubs and routes. No views are generated.

    IMPORTANT: The model must already exist before using this generator.

Example:
    bin/rails generate crud Product

    This will create:
        Controller:  app/controllers/products_controller.rb (with action stubs only)
        Routes:      Updates config/routes.rb

    bin/rails generate crud Product index show

    This will create only index and show actions:
        Controller:  app/controllers/products_controller.rb (with only index and show action stubs)
        Routes:      Updates config/routes.rb with only: [:index, :show]

Prerequisites:
    The model must exist before running this generator. If the model doesn't exist,
    you'll see an error message with instructions to create it first.

    Example:
    bin/rails generate model Product name:string description:text price:decimal active:boolean
    bin/rails db:migrate
    bin/rails generate crud Product

Actions:
    If no actions are specified, all CRUD actions will be generated: index, show, new, edit
    If actions are specified, only those actions (and their dependencies) will be generated:
    - index: Lists all records
    - show: Shows a single record
    - new: Creates new records (includes create action)
    - edit: Edits records (includes update and destroy actions)

Features:
    - Creates minimal controller with action stubs
    - Each action contains only a comment "# Write your real logic here"
    - No views are generated - you write your own
    - Routes are properly configured
    - Inherits from ApplicationController for frontend use
    - Perfect for AI-assisted development without template constraints

Supported field types:
    string, text, integer, decimal, float, boolean, date, datetime, timestamp, time

Model Requirements:
    - Model must inherit from ApplicationRecord
    - Model file should be in app/models/
    - Database table should exist (run migrations)

Examples:
    # For existing User model - all actions
    bin/rails generate crud User

    # For existing Article model - only index and show
    bin/rails generate crud Article index show

    # For existing Category model - only new and edit
    bin/rails generate crud Category new edit

    # For existing Post model - only index
    bin/rails generate crud Post index
