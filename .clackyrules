### Some important tips when coding

When you need to register/authentication system, don't write it yourself. Use `rails generate authentication` generate it first.

Do not generate any fake data that should originally be in the database for users.

Do not write any business logic in the admin backend that should only be for website management and maintenance.

Generate images using this placeholder website: https://images.unsplash.com/ if you need static assets

Use `rails generate service xxx` to generate a service file, not generate by yourself.

When installing libraries, try to specify the version you are most familiar with (e.g., npm, bundle) instead of the latest version.

Use `rails generate admin_crud xxx` (where xxx is your model name that you created before) to create the initial CRUD when developing the admin management page

Use `rails generate stripe_pay` to generate the initial order/payment logic when developing Stripe payment functionality. Default to Stripe if not specified

Do not use `to_param` in model, no need friendly url.

Do not use `rails console` for testing, use `rails runner` instead.

Never edit `application.html.erb`
