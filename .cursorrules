### Startup Command:

bin/dev (Do not use `rails s` directly, as it may cause js/css loading issues)

### The project uses the following tech stack:

Ruby on Rails 7.2
daisyUI 4( with tailwind 3 )
Figaro
PostgreSQL
Active_Storage for upload file
Kaminari
Mina
Puma
RSpec

Do not add or remove any components and avoid upgrading or downgrading components lightly.

## When you should restart project

In most cases, restarting project is unnecessary because Rails automatically hot-reloads code changes. However, changes to files within the `config/` directory (except `config/routes.rb`), including updates to configurations like `config/application.yml`, explicitly require a project restart.

Always keep UI responsiveness in mind when coding for user interfaces.

Use `rails generate admin_crud xxx` (where xxx is your model name that you created before) to create the initial CRUD when developing the admin management page

Do not use `to_param` in model, no need friendly url.

Do not use `rails console`, use `rails runner` instead if need testing.
