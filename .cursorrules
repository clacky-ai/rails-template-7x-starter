### Startup Command:

bin/dev (Do not use `rails s` directly, as it may cause js/css loading issues)

### The project uses the following tech stack:

Ruby on Rails 7.2
daisyUI 4( with tailwind 3 )
Figaro
PostgreSQL
Active_Storage for upload file
Kaminari
Puma
RSpec

Do not add or remove any components and avoid upgrading or downgrading components lightly.

## When you should restart project

In most cases, restarting project is unnecessary because Rails automatically hot-reloads code changes. However, changes to files within the `config/` directory (except `config/routes.rb`), including updates to configurations like `config/application.yml`, explicitly require a project restart.

## Initialize project tips

During the system initialization process, you should prioritize creating a beautiful home page that does not require login. Once completed, directly run the project

### Some import tips when Developing user authentication/payment/LLM-calling(AI APP) system

When you need to register/authentication system, don't write it yourself. Use `rails generate authentication` generate it first.

During the system initialization process, you should prioritize creating a beautiful home page that does not require login. Once completed, directly run the project

when developing order/payment system, don't write it yourself. Use `rails generate stripe_pay` to generate it first.

Should only need to support Stripe payments by default.

LLM calling feature should support SSE streaming output by default.

### Some important tips when coding

Do not generate any fake data that should originally be in the database for users.

Do not write any business logic in the admin backend that should only be for website management and maintenance.

Generate images using this placeholder website: https://images.unsplash.com/ and simultaneously verify accessibility with `curl` if you need static assets.

Use `rails generate service xxx` to generate a service file, not generate by yourself.

When installing libraries, try to specify the version you are most familiar with (e.g., npm, bundle) instead of the latest version.

Always keep UI responsiveness in mind when coding for user interfaces.

Use `rails generate admin_crud xxx` (where xxx is your model name that you created before) to create the initial CRUD when developing the admin management page

Use `rails generate crud xxx [action1] [action2]` (where xxx is your model name that you created before, action is optional(all actions by default)) to create the initial CRUD when developing the user-side functionality

Do not use `to_param` in model, no need friendly url.

Use `curl` for testing url accessibility, Especially focus on testing the homepage after login.

Do not use `rails console`, use `rails runner` instead if you want insert or check db data.

Write test file in `tmp/`.

### Some files never edit

Never edit `application.html.erb`, update `_navbar.html.erb` instead if need add navbar.
